# DashMaster

Initial Phase 1 scaffolding for the DashMaster platform. The repository now
contains the companion FastAPI service, a SvelteKit operator UI shell, firmware
placeholders, and proxy utilities. Use `make dev` for start-up tips and consult
`apps/companion/dashmaster` for the backend implementation.
